### Description
Traditional spreadsheet applications, such as Microsoft excel provide a method to represent the data, they do not design the table with visualization and table design principles.

We were motivated to create a visualization tool that could operationalize the visualization principles proposed by Edward Tufte and table design principles proposed by Stephen Few. TabViz, the new interactive web tool is that tool.

TabViz provides an interface for the user to upload data in csv or tsv format. The user is then given the chance to provide information about each of the columns. The table is then visualized based on the user input.

TabViz further affords exploration and enquiry of the table through a menu that gives the user the ability to hover over the rows and columns, display a bar-chart for quantitative values, compress vary large tables, sort the columns and summarize the columns and rows. Once the table is visualized, TabViz further provides the ability to export the final table visualization as a PNG image
